# March 19, 2018 Natual Gas/Crude Oil Volatility


- alpha (strategy) or market making
    - strategy: delta/gamma neutral; term structure of vol; seasonality
    - vol skew was reduced in recent years
- what products do you trade exactly? 
    - natural gas and WTI future options
    - spreads
    - avoid vix type products - directly trade term structures, which is equivalent
- study fundamentals - focus on individual plants ( gas, different hubs), or macro. mix, what are the balances; how much do those two views affect your trades respectively
    - industry-led fundamentals: previously natural gas vol comes from pipeline construction, now fixed
    - now more firm behavior led fundamentals: balance sheet, e.g. capital for drilling set
- fundamental or quantitative, percentage of the market
- trading frequency, systematic or discretionary
- how do you study supply and demand, modeling or forecasting?
    - outsourced
- other products and asset classes (weather, FX, equities) that you would keep a close eye on while you are trading gas and oil
    - natural gas not very correlated to equities
    - crude oil is more correlated since it is denominated in USD; sensitive to rates

- natural gas becoming base-level fuel, replacing coals >> GDP, export/import game theory>>might be helpful to see how coal behaved
- difference between CTA/CPO and hedge funds:
    - hedge funds more black box, managed account
    - CTA - master account, allocate trades to clients' account
